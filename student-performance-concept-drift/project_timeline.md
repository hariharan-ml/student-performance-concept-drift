# Project Development Timeline

This timeline reflects the conceptual and experimental progression of the study rather than exact coding timestamps.

The project was carried out as a structured self-study on adaptive machine learning systems during January–February 2026.

## Jan 20 – Jan 21
Understanding concept drift in predictive modelling and reviewing student performance datasets.

### Jan 22 – Jan 23
Data loading, preprocessing strategy, feature encoding, and target variable design (PASS/FAIL).

## Jan 24 – Jan 25
Baseline supervised model training and evaluation (Random Forest and Logistic Regression).

## Jan 26 – Jan 27
Design of streaming data simulation using sequential student batches.

## Jan 28 – Jan 29
Artificial concept drift introduced by modifying academic behaviour patterns.

## Jan 30 – Feb 1
Integration of ADWIN drift detection and monitoring prediction error behaviour.

## Feb 2 – Feb 3
Automatic retraining mechanism after drift detection.

### Feb 4 – Feb 5
Performance comparison, visualization, and experimental conclusions.

The final notebook and report were organized and published afterwards for reproducibility and documentation.
